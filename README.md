This read me and associated assignment are adapted from [Jeremey Manning's Psych 32 Assignment Hello, World!](github.com/ContextLab/psyc32-hello-world/) and from [Marc Gershow's NYUExperimentalPhysics1-2021/Assignment0
](github.com/NYU-IEP-2022-2023-Assignments/Assignment0).

This is a template repository for **Intro Experimental Physics II Assignment 1**. We will be using Google Colaboratory and Github Classroom to submit Python assignments in this course. The template for each assignment will provide a framework for you to work with.  Your job is to follow each assignment's instructions and fill in the missing pieces of code and/or text. In this assignment we will go through the steps of opening, editing, saving, and submitting your code.  

# Setup
First, you will need access to Google Drive and Github. You can use the Google Drive associated with your nyu.edu email address, or you can use another Google account. If you do not already have a Github account, you will need to create one. You can use [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ContextLab/cs-for-psych/blob/master/slides/module_1/introduction_and_overview.ipynb) to read more about setting up Google and Github accounts if needed. 

Once you are logged in to your Drive and to Github, use [this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/AfqMQJGp) to officially accept this assignment. When you accept an assignment (e.g., using the GitHub classroom link above) this uses the assignment's template repository to create a personal "fork" (copy) of the files.  A message should inform you where this fork is located (i.e., a web address); this will normally be something like `https://github.com/NYU-Intro-Experimental-Physics-II-Spr24//Assignment1-<username>`, where "`<username>`" is replaced with your actual GitHub username.

Next, open (click) the `Assignment1.ipynb` notebook and then click on the blue "Open in Colab" button at the top. A new tab or window should open in your browser, displaying the notebook in Google Colaboratory.

In order to submit your assignment **you'll need to save an editable copy of your notebook**. (You cannot save changes to the original version of the notebook.) Click `File > Save a copy in Drive` and then save your copy of the notebook as `Assignment1.ipynb` (i.e., remove the "`Copy of`" text that gets automatically appended to the beginning of the filename).
Close the original notebook; you no longer need it. 

The final setup task is to ensure that Colaboratory has access to your private repositories on GitHub.  (By default, your assignment repositories will be accessible only to you and the course instructor.) To give Colaboratory access to your private repositories:
- Navigate to [http://colab.research.google.com/github](http://colab.research.google.com/github)
- Make sure the "Include Private Repos" checkbox is checked
- In the popup window, sign into your GitHub account and authorize Colab to read private files

# Do the assignment
All of the assignment instructions are in the Jupyter (.ipynb) notebook. You should do your work on the assignment in the *copied* notebook (i.e., the copied notebook that you have the ability to save and edit). Once you have gone through the entire notebook and filled in any missing pieces of code and/or text, you can submit your work. 

# Submit your work
Submitting the assignment entails syncing your copy of the notebook with your GitHub repository (in this case, `NYU-Intro-Experimental-Physics-II-Spr24/Assignment1-<username>`, with `<username>` replaced with your GitHub username).  From within Colaboratory, open your notebook and click File > Save a copy in GitHub.  Select `NYU-Intro-Experimental-Physics-II-Spr24/Assignment1-<username>` from the Repository drop-down menu, and type '`Assignment1.ipynb`' into the File path text box.  Optionally, you may also enter a description into the "Commit message" text box (or you can just leave the default message).  Make sure that the "Include a link to Colaboratory" box is checked, and press "OK".  A new tab or window should open up, displaying your submitted notebook from within your GitHub repository.

Before leaving the lab, confirm with your laboratory instructor that you have correctly completed the assignment and submitted your work. You will follow the same procedure to submit future Python assignments in this course, so make sure you can follow these steps now!
